Users should allocate unique increasing id values when adding new autopilots to a network.</li><li>GCS systems and developer APIs typically use an ID at the top of the numeric range to reduce ID clashes (e.g. 255). Often their system ID is configurable to allow multi-GCS systems.</li></ul></li><li>The <em>component id</em> is allocated by type and number from <a href="./../messages/common.html#MAV_COMPONENT">MAV_COMPONENT</a>.</li></ul><p>Messages can be intended for all systems, specific systems, all components in a system, or specific components within a system. The protocol defines two 8-bit fields that can (optionally) be specified in the message payload to indicate where the message should be sent/routed.

They are expected to route/resend messages that are intended for other (or all) recipients to other active channels (i.e. MAVLink systems may be connected across different transports, connected by a MAVLink system that routes the messages). Broadcast messages are forwarded to all channels that haven&#39;t seen the message.
