It&#39;s reference implementation in C is highly optimized for resource-constrained systems with limited RAM and flash memory. It is field-proven and deployed in many products where it serves as interoperability interface between components of different manufacturers.</p></blockquote><p>MAVLink was first released early 2009 by Lorenz Meier and has now a <a href="https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink/graphs/contributors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">significant number of contributors</a>.</p><p>The content of this book is CC-BY 4.0 licensed.</p>',6)]))}const u=i(a,[["render",n]]);export{h as __pageData,u as default};
