The rest of the messages must be broadcast/published once per 3 seconds (the rules in some regions have tightened this requirement to 1 second for also the <a href="#OPEN_DRONE_ID_BASIC_ID">BASIC ID</a> and the <a href="#OPEN_DRONE_ID_SYSTEM">SYSTEM</a> message. Please see <a href="https://github.com/opendroneid/opendroneid-core-c#comparison" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>).</p><p>Not all message types or fields within a message type are mandatory to broadcast/publish. The mandatory message set vary from region to region.

Although popular autopilot SW stacks will be verified to be capable of this, the compliance testing will have been done using a certain set of HW/SW components. Any deviation from this set, will require the integrator of the UAS to consider the combination of the above requirements when deciding the internal update rates for each component, in the MAVLink network, generating data for the RID transmitter component.</p><p>It must be expected that there will be some delays from e.g. the GCS sending a <a href="#OPEN_DRONE_ID_SYSTEM">SYSTEM</a> message via the flight controller to the RID transmitter component. The RID transmitter component will gather this data plus data from other messages together and generate the final message data set, which is broadcast over the air. Each of these components will be running on their own update and forward/relay cycle and can thus introduce delays. I.e. running everything at exactly one second cycles, probably will lead to violations of the data &quot;freshness&quot; requirement. But going to the other extreme of forcing all messages to be at 10+ Hz would likely lead to unnecessary airwave noise on the (Command and Control) C2 link/Wi-Fi/Bluetooth spectrum. Components are expected to tune refresh rates to ensure compliance, without saturating internal communication links.</p><p>RID broadcasting using Bluetooth 4 Legacy Advertising introduces additional complexity to this. For Bluetooth 5 or Wi-Fi Beacon/NaN, all messages are packed together and broadcast in a single advertisement by the RID transmitter component. Bluetooth 4 advertisements can only contain 25 bytes and thus can fit only a single message. Since typically at least three messages must be broadcast on the air per second, the BT4 RID transmitter component must advertise at least every 333 ms.</p><h2 id="routing" tabindex="-1">Routing drone ID MAVLink messages inside the UAS <a class="header-anchor" href="#routing" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Routing drone ID MAVLink messages inside the UAS {#routing}&quot;">​</a></h2><p>There can be multiple MAVLink components in an UAS involved in the handling of drone ID data.

E.g. for data received via Bluetooth Legacy Advertising (Bluetooth 4.x), many of the received messages will not contain the unique serial number/ID of the UA that broadcasted the data, due to the severe size limitation imposed by Legacy Advertising where only one 25 byte message can be broadcasted in one advertisement radio burst. The MAC address (possibly randomized) of the Bluetooth HW is the only way to associate these messages to the same UA. For Bluetooth 5.x and Wi-Fi, it is possible that the same can happen in certain specific situations (e.g. sending large amount of authentication data), although for the majority of normal usage this is unlikely, since the use of <a href="#OPEN_DRONE_ID_MESSAGE_PACK">MESSAGE_PACK</a>s is mandated. For data received via internet, the data packet will always contain the unique serial number/ID of the originating UA but no associated MAC address.</p><p>In order to allow e.g. a DAA component to sort and identify which UA each data message has originated from, the RID receiver components must add, to the MAVLink message, either the MAC address or the ID number associated with the UA that originated the data message, before sending it on the internal UAS MAVLink network. This information must be added in the <code>id_or_mac</code> field of each MAVLink message.</p><p>The serial/ID is copied directly from the <code>uas_id</code> field with NULLs in the unused portion. The MAC address must be entered in ASCII format with NULLs in the unused portion. Any separation characters must be removed. E.g. &quot;30-65-EC-6F-C4-58&quot; or &quot;30:65:EC:6F:C4:58&quot; must be represented as the ASCII string &quot;3065EC6FC458&quot;. When not used for the above purpose, the <code>id_or_mac</code> field must be filled with NULLs.</p><p>The MAVLink system/component listening to the MAVLink messages must be aware that it is possible to receive drone ID data from the same UA via multiple receive paths (e.g. Wi-Fi and internet). Filtering and merging of the data (and possible deletion of duplicates) will be needed and it must keep track of both a possible MAC address and the serial/ID of the other UAs. Additional filtering and sorting based on the timestamp in the <a href="#OPEN_DRONE_ID_LOCATION">LOCATION</a> or <a href="#OPEN_DRONE_ID_SYSTEM">SYSTEM</a> messages can also be needed in order to generate a consistent flight path for the other UAs.</p>',65)])])}const _=a(i,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,_ as default};
