This topic explains how you can ensure that your components are updated appropriately when the system id of the autopilot is changed, and how to ensure that they each have a unique component id.</p><h2 id="综述" tabindex="-1">综述 <a class="header-anchor" href="#综述" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;综述&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Generally MAVLink flight stacks give the autopilot component a default system id of 1 and a component id of <a href="./../messages/common.html#MAV_COMP_ID_AUTOPILOT1">MAV_COMP_ID_AUTOPILOT1</a> (also <code>1</code>).</p><p>Other MAVLink components typically also have a default system id of <code>1</code>, and a component id that is the default for the component&#39;s type (such as <a href="./../messages/common.html#MAV_COMP_ID_CAMERA">MAV_COMP_ID_CAMERA</a> for a MAVLink camera). This ensures that they will often work with autopilots &quot;out of the box&quot; when setting up a system for the first time.</p><p>In a more complex MAVLink system you will have multiple vehicles, so you will need to assign each vehicle a unique system id, and have a mechanism to change the associated components to that same id.</p><p>In a single system you may also have multiple components of the same type. In this case you will need to ensure that each has a unique component id.</p><p>The following section suggests a process to allow MAVLink components to automatically update themselves with the correct ids.</p><h2 id="system-id-assignment" tabindex="-1">System Id Assignment <a class="header-anchor" href="#system-id-assignment" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;System Id Assignment&quot;">​</a></h2><p>First change the system ID of the autopilot component. This is usually done with a flight-stack specific parameter such as <a href="https://docs.px4.io/main/en/advanced_config/parameter_reference.html#MAV_SYS_ID" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">MAV_SYS_ID</a> (PX4) or <a href="https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/parameters.html#sysid-thismav-mavlink-system-id-of-this-vehicle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SYSID_THISMAV</a> (ArduCopter).</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p><a href="./../messages/development.html#MAV_CMD_DO_SET_SYS_CMP_ID">MAV_CMD_DO_SET_SYS_CMP_ID</a> is a work-in-progress command for setting and changing system and command ids.</p></div><p>Then reboot the vehicle off-network, so that the only autopilot visible to components should be the one on the vehicle (you can disconnect your telemetry radio, for example).</p><p>On boot, components should look for autopilot <code>HEARTBEAT</code> messages.</p><p>If <code>HEARTBEAT</code> messages are detected from:</p><ul><li>Only one autopilot within 3 seconds of the first autopilot heartbeat being detected, the component should set its system id to match that of the autopilot.</li><li>Multiple autopilots within the first 3 seconds then the autopilot should keep its current system id.

If the vehicle has only one component of a particular type, then this is usually sufficient to avoid clashes.</p><p>When there are multiple instances of a particular component, each will need a unique id. The easiest way to do this is to sequentially allocate component IDs from the allocated ranges, such as <a href="./../messages/common.html#MAV_COMP_ID_CAMERA2">MAV_COMP_ID_CAMERA2</a>. The mechanisms to set and change component ids are component-dependent (and some components may not allow the component id to be changed).</p><p>Note that in theory any component can have any id. However associating components with their well-known component ids makes it easier to, for example, associate a gimbal with a camera, or capture an image using a particular camera.</p>',21)]))}const u=t(n,[["render",i]]);export{d as __pageData,u as default};
